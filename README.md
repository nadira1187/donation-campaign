## Three project features of donation-campaign-assignment
# Search Functionality :
I have included a search functionality that enables visitors to submit a search phrase in an input field and press the "Search" button in the code for the Banner component. The callback function (onSearch) that is provided as a prop receives the search query after that. Users can search for particular material within the program using this function.
# Display Donations :
I retrieve and display a list of donations in the DonationPage component. The donations are retrieved from the local storage of the browser, and if any are discovered, they are shown as cards in a grid style. There is also a "See More" button that, when pressed, displays all the donation options. Users can browse and interact with a list of donations using this feature.
# Calculation of the Donation Percentage :
I compute and display the donation percentage in the Statistics component. This function determines how much of "Your Donation" is relative to "Total Donation." It gives users information about their contribution as a proportion of all donations. Users can better grasp the percentage's impact because it is shown by a pie chart.
